The Code2.R, Data1-plot.csv, and Data2-treatment.csv are used in supporting the study titled "Nutrient effects on plant diversity loss arise from nutrient identity and decreasing niche dimension".
In this study we independently manipulated the supply of eight nutrients to isolate the effects of the identity of added nutrients versus the number of added nutrients on diversity loss in a meadow grassland.
The Code2.R is written in R.
The Data1-plot.csv is data from each plot and the Data2-treatment.csv is data from each treatment.
Open the Code2.R, run the codes by using the data from the two CSV files.
